#CONCEPT:

*Sheep!* is a unique multi-contract Profile Pic based NFT experience with rewards. It ignores the traditional goals of Tokenomics -e.g., protocol sustainability, maximizing profits for early adopters, and minimizing gameability. Instead, Sheep!’s mechanics are designed to tell a story, pose questions, create a novel experience for participants, and push the boundaries of Profile Pic (PFP) NFTs.

Sheep! is designed with careful consideration to the following: the crypto market’s climate, its participant’s interactions and inclinations, and the value driven hype around NFTs. Through a material reading of these and other aspects of cryptocurrency, combined with Sheep!’s mechanics and tokenomics and a semiotic reading of the Sheep! imagery, an interactive meta narrative about the current state of the NFT market (and markets in general) emerges.

It is gameable by design: Packs will be formed. Sheep will be sacrificed. Those not strong enough will perish. Innovation and a little bit of luck are the only way to survive.


#HOW IT WORKS:
The Sheep! ecosystem is composed of the following tokens:
- 5 ultra rare pixel sheep
- 4242 unique golden sheep NFT utility tokens
- 6666 unique hungry wolf PFP NFTs
- Fleece, a ERC20 token ($FLCE)

First, the 4247 sheep are released.

Next, 6666 wolves are released.

55% of the minting fees of the wolves (up to $124,465 if the wolves sell out), is to be placed into an LP. These LP tokens and their resulting rewards will be locked into a contract.

Wolf owners will claim $FLCE at the beginning of each week. The amount dropped is based on the stats of the individual wolf. $FLCE can be redeemed for a percentage of the reward tokens locked in the contract. However, by the end of each week, a set amount of $FLCE must be fed to each wolf in order for it to survive. This $FLCE is burned. If the wolf is not fed enough fleece, it will die. The NFT will still exist, but the token’s image will change into a dead version of the wolf, and it will receive no more $FLCE.

If dead for less than 1 week, a wolf can be revived by feeding it a Pixel Sheep or a Golden Sheep. This will burn the sheep NFT, deflating the supply and creating more rarity. The wolf’s stats will be altered based on its stats relationship to the stats of the sheep that it eats.

After 2 years, the LP tokens will be evenly distributed among the remaining living wolves. These wolves will remain eternally alive. If at any time there is only one wolf left, the LP tokens can be claimed by that wolf’s owner.


#STORAGE

The NFT images and metadata are uploaded to the permaweb on the Arweave Blockchain.

Front ends are hosted on DigitalOcean. After the end of the hunger phase, will be migrated to the Arweave permaweb.
